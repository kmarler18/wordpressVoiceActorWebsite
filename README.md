# wordpress_VoiceActor_Website

This is the website for my voice acting business. You can view the website <a href="https://voiceofkyle.wordpress.com/">here</a>.

I used the Appleton theme. I replaced the theme’s standard image gallery with videos. I added an anchor element to all of the main sections of the page. This allowed for easy navigation from the nav menu.

As I began to test the site across devices and browsers, I noticed the opening H2 heading was wrapping to a new line at an awkward place. I decreased the font size so that it wouldn’t wrap to a new line on smaller devices. 

In the end, the site looks elegant and is fully responsive across devices.
